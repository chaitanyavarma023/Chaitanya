Description:  LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) is an industry standard protocol designed
 to supplant proprietary Link-Layer protocols such as
 Extreme's EDP (Extreme Discovery Protocol) and
 CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol).
 The goal of LLDP is to provide an inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver
 Link-Layer notifications to adjacent network devices.
